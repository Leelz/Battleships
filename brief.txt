## Goal
 
Battleships is a 2-player game. Each player has 2 boards - a primary board and a tracking board. On their primary board, they lay out their own ships prior to the start of the game. On their tracking board, they record the results of missiles they have fired into their opponent's grid.
 
The winner is the first player to hit every one of their opponent's squares that contain a ship.
 
## Requirements
 
Please complete the requirements in order.
 
### Build a board
 
A board is a 10x10 grid. Each square is either empty or full. Build a primary board for each player and mark 17 squares within that grid as full.
 
### Tracking board
 
Each player has a tracking board. This is a 10x10 grid which tracks the shots that the player has fired onto their opponents primary board.
 
In addition to the empty or full states, each square has an initial, unknown, state for each square. When a user selects a square in the tracking grids, the unknown value should change to match the corresponding value on the other player's primary grid.
 
### Validate layout
 
A valid board has 17 full squares. These represent 5 ships, who have a width of
1 square, and are aligned either horizontally or vertically on the grid, and do not overlap.
 
These consist of:
 
* 1 ship of length 5;
* 1 ship of length 4;
* 2 ships of length 3;
* 1 ship of length 2;
 
Ensure that the boards from step 1 are valid.
 
### Determine winner
 
Players should take turns to select a square on their tracking board.
 
If, after their turn, all of their opponents full squares have been discovered, the player is declared the winner.
